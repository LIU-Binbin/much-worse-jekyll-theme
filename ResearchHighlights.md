<!--We discovered non-centered inversion symmetries in the momentum space from projective
symmetry algebras, identified and characterized novel twisted inverse topological edge
states with off-centered crossing points in the momentum space, distinct from edge
states protected by the normal inversion symmetry. Designed topological circuits to
simulate the nontrivial states.-->

The spacial inversion symmetry is one of the most important symmetries which inverses the real space position as well as the
momentum of a physical system relative to the original point in the real and momentum spaces. Here,
we discover a new kind of inversion symmetry which inverses the real space position relative to the
origin but is non-centered in the momentum space. We derive the momentum-non-centered inversion
symmetry with projectively enriched symmetry algebras and demonstrate it in Hamiltonians in
π-flux lattices in both 2D and 3D. 

Intriguingly, we discover Mobius insulators with shifted-inverse
edge states at half-fillings and a high Chern number insulator that has off-centered chiral edge
states at quarter-fillings, which have not been reported before. We also define quantized topological
numbers that indicate the existence of the novel edge states with off-centered crossing points in the
momentum space. We design topological circuits that correspond to our Hamiltonian and perform
simulations, which agree with our theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest new routes for
exploring topological edge responses with projective symmetries in artificial systems.

We discovered Rashba spin-splitting quantum well states developed near the surface of Bi2Se3 decorated with transition-metal atoms Cu or Au, explaining the observed unusual large BMR in experiments. <br />

We identified twisted bilayer α-graphyne as a new second-order topological insulator from
first-principles and demonstrated that the second-order topological states in moiré honey-comb lattices are generally
induced by moiré magnetism or Zeeman fields.
