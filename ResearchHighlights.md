## Non-centered inversion symmetry in momentum space <br />

<!--We discovered non-centered inversion symmetries in the momentum space from projective
symmetry algebras, identified and characterized novel twisted inverse topological edge
states with off-centered crossing points in the momentum space, distinct from edge
states protected by the normal inversion symmetry. Designed topological circuits to
simulate the nontrivial states.-->

The spacial inversion symmetry inverses the position and momentum of a physical system relative to the original point. Here,
we discover a new kind of inversion symmetry that inverses the real space position relative to the
origin but is _non-centered_ in the momentum space. We derive the _momentum-non-centered inversion
symmetry_ with projectively enriched symmetry algebras and demonstrate it in Hamiltonians in
π-flux lattices in both 2D and 3D. 

With the non-centered inversion symmetry, we discover Mobius insulators with shifted-inverse
edge states at half-fillings and a high Chern number insulator that has off-centered chiral edge
states at quarter-fillings, which have not been reported before. We also define quantized topological
numbers that indicate the existence of the novel edge states with off-centered crossing points in the
momentum space. We design topological circuits that correspond to our Hamiltonian and perform
simulations, which agree with our theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest new routes for
exploring topological edge responses with projective symmetries in artificial systems.

## Large Bilinear Magnetoresistance (BMR) from Rashba Spin-Splitting on the Surface of a Topological Insulator <br />
We discover Rashba spin-splitting quantum well states developed near the surface of \(Bi_2Se_3\) decorated with transition-metal atoms Cu or Au, which, with the band bending process, explains the observed unusual large BMR in experiments. <br />

We identify the twisted bilayer α-graphyne as a new second-order topological insulator from first-principles and model calculations and demonstrat that the second-order topological states in moiré honey-comb lattices are generally induced by moiré magnetism or Zeeman fields.
