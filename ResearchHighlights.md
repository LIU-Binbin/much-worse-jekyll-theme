# Non-centered inversion symmetry in momentum space <br />
We discovered non-centered inversion symmetries in the momentum space from projective
symmetry algebras, identified and characterized novel twisted inverse topological edge
states with off-centered crossing points in the momentum space, distinct from edge
states protected by the normal inversion symmetry. Designed topological circuits to
simulate the nontrivial states.
