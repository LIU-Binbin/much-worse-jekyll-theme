We discover a new form of inversion symmetry that inverses the real space position relative to the origin but is _non-centered_ in the momentum space. We derive the _momentum-non-centered inversion symmetry (MNCIS)_ with projectively enriched symmetry algebras and demonstrate it in π-flux lattices in both 2D and 3D. 

With the MNCIS, we discover very interesting states that have not been reported before, such as Mobius insulators with shifted-inverse edge states and a high Chern number insulator that has off-centered chiral edge states. We also define quantized topological numbers that capture the topology enforced by the MNCIS. To realize our theory, we design topological circuits to simulate our model Hamiltonians, which suggest new routes for exploring artificial systems and metamaterials with projective symmetries.<br />

## Large Bilinear Magnetoresistance (BMR) from Rashba Spin-Splitting on the Surface of a Topological Insulator <br />

We discover Rashba spin-splitting quantum well states developed near the surface of bismuth selenide decorated with transition-metal atoms Cu or Au, which, with the band bending process, explain the observed unusual large BMR in our experiments. We use the semiclassical Boltzmann approach to quantitatively assist our analysis. Our work identifies Cu as a preferential material to engineer bismuth selenide into a Rashba material and demonstrates the BMR as an electrical transport signature to assist the search for inversion asymmetric topological insulator heterostructures with large Rashba spin-splitting. <br />

We identified twisted bilayer α-graphyne and γ-graphyne as second-order topological insulators in 2D and real Chern insulators with higher-order hinge states in 3D, respectively, using first-principles calculations, and demonstrated the induction of higher-order topological states in these materials through effective moiré magnetism or Zeeman fields.<br />
