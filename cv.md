I embed a current version of my CV below. Download [PDF version](https://github.com/LIU-Binbin/LIU-Binbin.github.io/blob/main/assets/CV_BinBin_Liu.pdf). 
{% The PDF should be embedded underneath -- uses Google Docs for embedding and works if the PDF is on dropbox. Works sporadically if PDF is elsewhere too. %}
