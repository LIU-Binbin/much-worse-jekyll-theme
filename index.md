I am a physics master's student, part of [Prof. Xian-Lei Sheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MDetOEgAAAAJ)'s group at Beihang University, and collaborating with [Prof. Shengyuan A. Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q-eIAcIAAAAJ) at SUTD. My research mainly focuses on investigating the **topological properties** of materials and metamaterials with potential applications. I'm also interested in studying **complex** and **strongly correlated** systems and developing numeric techniques to explore them. 
 
  I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position in condensed matter physics and related fields, with a focus on computations and theories.
