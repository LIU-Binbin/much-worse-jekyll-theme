 I am a physics master’s student in [Prof. Xian-Lei Sheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MDetOEgAAAAJ)’s group at Beihang University, with broad research interests in topological condensed matter physics and material sciences. I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position focusing on computations and theories, although I am also interested in experiments in related fields.
