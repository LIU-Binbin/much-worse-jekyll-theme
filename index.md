 I am a physics master’s student in Prof. Xian-Lei Sheng’s group at Beihang University, with broad research interests in topological condensed matter physics and material sciences. I am currently looking for a Ph. D. position focusing on computations and theories, although I am also interested in experiments in related fields.

## Short CV
2020-present: M. sc. in Physics, Beihang University, Beijing, China <br />
2016-2020: B. sc. in Applied Physics, Honors College of Beihang University, Beijing, China <br />
