I am a physics master's student in Prof. Xian-Lei Sheng’s group at Beihang University, after my bachelor’s degree at the same University. I have broad research interests in topological condensed matter physics and material’s transport. I am currently looking for a Ph. D. position in related fields, focusing on computations and theories. I am also interested in doing experiments.
